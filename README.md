# Graphical-Tower-of-Hanoi
I created the graphical Tower of Hanoi for Windows using Visual C++ with Microsoft Visual Studio as the IDE. Its main power lies in the fact that discs are self-adjusting and on increasing the number of discs their size automatically decreases to fit window size and also the colours of discs also changes automatically to distinguish between them. The discs move from one peg to another and every movement is displayed.
